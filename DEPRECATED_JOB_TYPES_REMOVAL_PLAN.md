- `CLEANUP_CAMPAIGN` - Campaign maintenance operations

---

## Executive Summary

This plan addresses the removal of deprecated job types from the FastAPI application and consolidates their functionality into the existing `ENRICH_LEAD` workflow. Based on comprehensive codebase analysis, the current architecture treats email copy generation and Instantly lead creation as steps within the `ENRICH_LEAD` task rather than separate job types.

## Current Architecture Analysis

### Job Type Usage Assessment
1. **ENRICH_LEAD** ✅ - Currently used, consolidates multiple operations
2. **FETCH_LEADS** ✅ - Currently used, primary lead acquisition workflow  
3. **CLEANUP_CAMPAIGN** ✅ - Currently used, maintenance operations
4. **ENRICH_LEADS** ❌ - Deprecated (old plural form)
5. **GENERAL** ❌ - Deprecated (default fallback, no specific business logic)
6. **GENERATE_EMAIL_COPY** ❌ - Deprecated (now part of ENRICH_LEAD workflow)
7. **UPLOAD_TO_INSTANTLY** ❌ - Deprecated (now part of ENRICH_LEAD workflow)
8. **VERIFY_EMAILS** ❌ - Deprecated (now part of ENRICH_LEAD workflow)

### Architecture Patterns Identified
- **Task Consolidation**: The `enrich_lead_task` performs multiple operations as steps:
  1. Email verification
  2. Perplexity enrichment
  3. Email copy generation
  4. Instantly lead creation
- **Job Tracking**: Each lead enrichment creates ONE `ENRICH_LEAD` job that tracks all steps
- **Error Handling**: Individual step failures are logged but don't fail the entire job
- **Progress Tracking**: Task state updates provide granular progress information

## General Rules & Instructions

* In interacting with the User, always make a technical, critical assessment for any queries, statements, ideas, questions... Don't be afraid to question the user's plan.
* Always ask for more clarification if needed from the user when implementing the steps of the plan.
* NEVER MAKE SHIT UP - always provide rationale for a decision.
* In cases where there are code edits, the ai agent is to perform the changes.
* In cases where there are commands to be run, the ai agent is to run them in the chat window context and parse the output for errors and other actionable information.
* When creating and running migrations, run the commands in the api docker container.
* Pay particular attention to the api testing logic (routes, service, model, tests). Always run the tests after making changes to the api.
* When running individual tests, run them in the api docker container: use 'docker exec api pytest...'
* When running the whole suite of tests, use 'make docker-test'.
* When planning code edits, plan to update the tests immediately.
* For functional api layer tests - the tests should hit the api and then check the database for results.

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Update Job Type Enum and Remove Deprecated Values
**Goal**: Clean up the JobType enum by removing deprecated values and updating all references

**Actions**:
1. Update `app/models/job.py` JobType enum to remove deprecated values
2. Update default value from `JobType.GENERAL` to `JobType.FETCH_LEADS` 
3. Update `app/schemas/job.py` default value
4. Update frontend `frontend/src/types/job.ts` enum

**Success Criteria**:
- All deprecated enum values removed from codebase
- No import errors when loading the application
- Job creation defaults to appropriate job type

**Testing Strategy**:
```bash
docker compose exec api python -c "from app.models.job import JobType; print([e.value for e in JobType])"
```

### Step 2: Create Database Migration to Remove Deprecated Enum Values
**Goal**: Update PostgreSQL enum to remove deprecated values and migrate existing data

**Actions**:
1. Create migration to update existing `GENERAL` jobs to `FETCH_LEADS` 
2. Remove deprecated enum values from PostgreSQL
3. Test migration rollback functionality

**Success Criteria**:
- Database enum only contains valid job types
- All existing jobs migrated to valid types
- No foreign key constraint violations

**Testing Strategy**:
```bash
docker compose exec api python -m alembic upgrade head
docker compose exec postgres psql -U postgres -d fastapi_k8_proto -c "SELECT enumlabel FROM pg_enum WHERE enumtypid = (SELECT oid FROM pg_type WHERE typname = 'jobtype') ORDER BY enumlabel;"
docker compose exec postgres psql -U postgres -d fastapi_k8_proto -c "SELECT job_type, count(*) FROM jobs GROUP BY job_type;"
```

### Step 3: Update Test Infrastructure 
**Goal**: Remove all references to deprecated job types in test files and fixtures

**Actions**:
1. Update test fixtures in `tests/fixtures/campaign_fixtures.py`
2. Update database helpers in `tests/helpers/database_helpers.py`
3. Update campaign task tests in `tests/test_campaign_tasks.py`
4. Update database helper tests in `tests/test_database_helpers.py`
5. Update Celery integration tests in `tests/test_celery_integration.py`

**Success Criteria**:
- All tests pass with updated job types
- No references to deprecated job types in test code
- Test fixtures create only valid job types

**Testing Strategy**:
```bash
docker compose exec api pytest tests/ -v
make docker-test
```

### Step 4: Update Frontend Integration
**Goal**: Ensure frontend components work with updated job types

**Actions**:
1. Update TypeScript job type enum
2. Verify job service handles updated types correctly
3. Test job creation and listing functionality

**Success Criteria**:
- Frontend builds without TypeScript errors
- Job creation works with valid job types
- Job listing displays correct job types

**Testing Strategy**:
- Manual testing of job creation UI
- Verify API responses match frontend expectations

### Step 5: Update Documentation and Configuration
**Goal**: Update all documentation and configuration files

**Actions**:
1. Update `.cursor/rules/custom_instructions.json` valid job types
2. Update migration documentation 
3. Update API documentation if present
4. Create architecture documentation for job type consolidation

**Success Criteria**:
- Documentation reflects current job types
- Configuration files updated
- Architecture documentation explains job consolidation pattern

### Step 6: Comprehensive Testing and Validation
**Goal**: Ensure the entire system works correctly after changes

**Actions**:
1. Run full test suite
2. Test campaign workflow end-to-end
3. Verify job creation, processing, and completion
4. Test error handling scenarios

**Success Criteria**:
- All tests pass
- Campaign workflow completes successfully
- Job tracking works correctly
- Error handling maintains existing behavior

**Testing Strategy**:
```bash
make docker-test
docker compose exec api python app/background_services/test_campaign_flow.py
```

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- Frontend enum updates (TypeScript compilation will catch errors)
- Test fixture updates (test failures will indicate issues)
- Documentation updates (no functional impact)

### Medium Risk  
- Database migration (requires careful testing and rollback plan)
- Default job type changes (could affect job creation)

### High Risk
- None identified - changes are primarily cleanup with no functional modifications

## Rollback Strategy

### Code Rollback
- All changes are in version control and can be reverted
- Database migration includes downgrade functionality

### Database Rollback
```bash
docker compose exec api python -m alembic downgrade -1
```

### Verification After Rollback
- Run existing tests to ensure functionality restored
- Check job creation still works with original types

## Migration Strategy

### Pre-Migration Checklist
- [ ] Backup database
- [ ] Verify current job type usage
- [ ] Review test coverage
- [ ] Plan rollback procedure

### Post-Migration Validation
- [ ] Verify enum values in database
- [ ] Check existing job data integrity  
- [ ] Run comprehensive test suite
- [ ] Test job creation with new defaults

## Dependencies and Considerations

### External Dependencies
- PostgreSQL enum modification capabilities
- Alembic migration system
- Frontend build system (TypeScript)

### Breaking Changes
- **API Contract**: Job creation default changes from `GENERAL` to `FETCH_LEADS`
- **Database Schema**: Enum values removed (reversible via migration)

### Backward Compatibility
- Existing job data preserved and migrated
- API endpoints maintain same interface
- Frontend job types updated to match backend

## Success Metrics

1. **Zero deprecated job types** in codebase or database
2. **All tests passing** after changes
3. **Campaign workflow functional** end-to-end
4. **Job creation working** with appropriate defaults
5. **Database integrity maintained** with proper enum values

## Implementation Timeline

1. **Steps 1-2**: Enum and migration updates (30 minutes)
2. **Step 3**: Test infrastructure updates (45 minutes)
3. **Step 4**: Frontend updates (15 minutes)
4. **Step 5**: Documentation updates (15 minutes)
5. **Step 6**: Comprehensive testing (30 minutes)

**Total Estimated Time**: 2 hours 15 minutes

## Technical Rationale

### Why Consolidate Job Types?
1. **Simplified Architecture**: Fewer job types reduce complexity
2. **Atomic Operations**: Lead enrichment is conceptually one business operation
3. **Better Error Handling**: Single job tracks multiple related steps
4. **Improved Monitoring**: One job to track instead of multiple coordinated jobs

### Why These Specific Removals?
- **ENRICH_LEADS**: Duplicate of ENRICH_LEAD (naming inconsistency)
- **GENERAL**: Generic type with no specific business logic
- **GENERATE_EMAIL_COPY**: Part of lead enrichment workflow
- **UPLOAD_TO_INSTANTLY**: Part of lead enrichment workflow  
- **VERIFY_EMAILS**: Part of lead enrichment workflow

### Architectural Impact
- **Reduced Complexity**: Fewer job types to manage and monitor
- **Consistent Naming**: All job types follow same naming convention
- **Clear Responsibility**: Each job type has specific, well-defined purpose
- **Better Testability**: Fewer combinations of job types to test

## Critical Assessment Questions

1. **Are there any external systems** that depend on these deprecated job types?
2. **Do any monitoring or alerting systems** reference these job types?
3. **Are there any scheduled jobs or cron tasks** that create these job types?
4. **Do any API clients** explicitly create jobs with these types?

## Documentation Updates Required

1. **API Documentation**: Update job type enum documentation
2. **Architecture Documentation**: Document job consolidation pattern
3. **Migration Documentation**: Record database schema changes
4. **Testing Documentation**: Update test patterns and examples
