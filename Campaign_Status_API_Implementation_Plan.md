# Campaign Status API Endpoint Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive, step-by-step plan for implementing a new API endpoint to retrieve the status of a campaign. The implementation will follow all existing patterns, conventions, and architectural decisions established in the FastAPI application.

## General Rules & Instructions

### Core Implementation Guidelines
- **Technical Assessment**: Make critical assessments of all queries, statements, ideas, and questions. Question plans that don't align with established patterns.
- **Clarification First**: Always ask for clarification when implementing steps if requirements are unclear.
- **Never Assume**: Provide clear rationale for all decisions. Never make assumptions without documentation.
- **Code Edits**: The AI agent must perform all code changes directly.
- **Command Execution**: Run all commands in the chat window and parse output for errors and actionable information.
- **Docker Commands**: Execute migrations within the API docker container.
- **Testing Priority**: Pay special attention to API testing logic (routes, service, model, tests). Always run tests after API changes.
- **Individual Tests**: Run individual tests in API docker container using `docker exec api pytest...`
- **Full Test Suite**: Use `make docker-test` for complete test execution.
- **Functional Tests Only**: Create comprehensive functional API layer tests that hit the API and verify database state. No unit tests required.
- **Test-First Development**: Plan and update tests immediately when planning code edits.

### Architecture & Pattern Compliance
- **Existing Patterns**: Maintain current architectural patterns, conventions, and configurations at all costs.
- **Pattern Documentation**: Document any significant changes to established patterns.
- **Code Documentation**: Use extensive docstrings and comments to provide context for decisions.
- **Pattern Changes**: Create markdown documents in the documentation directory for significant pattern changes.

## Current State Assessment

### Existing Campaign Endpoint Patterns
Based on codebase analysis, the current campaign endpoints follow these patterns:

1. **File Structure**:
   - `app/api/endpoints/campaigns.py` - Route definitions
   - `app/services/campaign.py` - Business logic
   - `app/schemas/campaign.py` - Request/response schemas
   - `app/models/campaign.py` - Database models

2. **Authentication**: All campaign endpoints are protected by `AuthenticationMiddleware`

3. **Error Handling Pattern**:
   ```python
   if not campaign:
       raise HTTPException(
           status_code=status.HTTP_404_NOT_FOUND,
           detail=f"Campaign {campaign_id} not found"
       )
   ```

4. **Service Layer Pattern**:
   - Service methods are async
   - Services return dictionaries from business logic
   - Controllers query database directly for response model creation
   - Error handling occurs at both service and controller layers

5. **Response Pattern**:
   - Use `CampaignResponse.from_campaign(campaign)` for consistent responses
   - Include valid transitions in responses

6. **Database Query Pattern**:
   ```python
   campaign = db.query(Campaign).filter(Campaign.id == campaign_id).first()
   ```

### Current Campaign Status Information
From `app/models/campaign_status.py`:
- `CREATED = "created"`
- `RUNNING = "running"`  
- `COMPLETED = "completed"`
- `FAILED = "failed"`

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Analysis and Schema Design
**Goal**: Create request and response schemas for the campaign status endpoint.

**Actions**:
1. Review existing schema patterns in `app/schemas/campaign.py`
2. Create `CampaignStatusRequest` schema for request validation
3. Create `CampaignStatusResponse` schema for the response
4. Ensure schemas follow existing patterns and validation rules

**Schema Requirements**:
- Request: Path parameter for `campaign_id` (string, UUID format)
- Response: `campaign_id`, `campaign_name`, `campaign_status` fields
- Follow existing Pydantic patterns with field validation
- Include proper docstrings and field descriptions

**Success Criteria**:
- Schemas validate correctly
- Follow existing naming conventions
- Include comprehensive field documentation
- Schema classes are properly typed

**Implementation Commands**:
```bash
# Navigate to schemas directory and examine existing patterns
# Edit app/schemas/campaign.py to add new schemas
```

### Step 2: Service Layer Implementation
**Goal**: Add business logic method to retrieve campaign status.

**Actions**:
1. Examine existing service methods in `app/services/campaign.py`
2. Add `get_campaign_status` method following existing async patterns
3. Implement proper error handling for non-existent campaigns
4. Follow existing logging patterns
5. Return dictionary format consistent with other service methods

**Service Method Requirements**:
- Method signature: `async def get_campaign_status(self, campaign_id: str, db: Session) -> Dict[str, Any]`
- Include comprehensive error handling
- Use existing logger pattern
- Return structured dictionary with campaign status information
- Handle database session properly
- Follow existing validation patterns for campaign_id

**Success Criteria**:
- Method follows existing async service patterns
- Proper error handling with appropriate HTTP exceptions
- Logging implementation matches existing patterns
- Returns consistent dictionary structure
- Database queries use established patterns

**Implementation Commands**:
```bash
# Edit app/services/campaign.py
# Add the new service method following existing patterns
```

### Step 3: API Endpoint Implementation  
**Goal**: Create the GET endpoint in the campaigns router.

**Actions**:
1. Add new route to `app/api/endpoints/campaigns.py`
2. Follow existing route pattern with path parameter
3. Implement proper dependency injection for database session
4. Use service layer for business logic
5. Create response using established schema patterns
6. Include comprehensive error handling

**Route Requirements**:
- Route path: `@router.get("/{campaign_id}/status", response_model=CampaignStatusResponse)`
- Protected route (inherits from existing auth middleware)
- Path parameter validation for campaign_id
- Database session dependency injection
- Service layer integration
- Proper HTTP status codes and error responses

**Success Criteria**:
- Route follows existing FastAPI patterns
- Proper OpenAPI documentation generation
- Authentication protection works correctly
- Error handling matches existing endpoints
- Response format is consistent

**Implementation Commands**:
```bash
# Edit app/api/endpoints/campaigns.py
# Add the new route following existing patterns
```

### Step 4: Functional Test Implementation
**Goal**: Create comprehensive functional tests for the new endpoint.

**Actions**:
1. Analyze existing test patterns in `tests/test_campaigns_api.py`
2. Add test cases for the new endpoint
3. Include authentication tests
4. Test success scenarios with database verification
5. Test error scenarios (campaign not found, invalid ID)
6. Follow existing test helper patterns

**Test Requirements**:
- Authentication required tests
- Successful status retrieval tests
- Campaign not found error tests
- Invalid campaign ID format tests
- Database state verification after API calls
- Use existing test fixtures and helpers
- Follow existing test naming conventions

**Test Cases to Implement**:
1. `test_get_campaign_status_requires_auth`
2. `test_get_campaign_status_success`
3. `test_get_campaign_status_not_found`
4. `test_get_campaign_status_invalid_id_format`
5. `test_get_campaign_status_database_verification`

**Success Criteria**:
- All tests pass
- Database state verification works correctly
- Authentication tests validate protection
- Error scenarios are properly tested
- Test patterns match existing conventions

**Implementation Commands**:
```bash
# Edit tests/test_campaigns_api.py
# Add comprehensive functional tests
```

### Step 5: Integration Testing
**Goal**: Verify the endpoint works correctly in the full application context.

**Actions**:
1. Run individual tests for the new endpoint
2. Run full campaign test suite
3. Verify endpoint appears in OpenAPI documentation
4. Test manual curl commands if needed
5. Verify database queries are efficient

**Testing Commands**:
```bash
# Run individual tests
docker exec api pytest tests/test_campaigns_api.py::test_get_campaign_status_success -v

# Run full campaign test suite  
docker exec api pytest tests/test_campaigns_api.py -v

# Run complete test suite
make docker-test
```

**Success Criteria**:
- All new tests pass
- Existing tests remain unbroken
- OpenAPI documentation includes new endpoint
- Manual testing confirms expected behavior
- No performance regressions in database queries

### Step 6: Documentation and Cleanup
**Goal**: Ensure proper documentation and code quality.

**Actions**:
1. Verify all docstrings are comprehensive
2. Check code formatting and style consistency
3. Update any relevant documentation files
4. Ensure no temporary files remain
5. Verify logging outputs are appropriate

**Documentation Requirements**:
- All new code includes proper docstrings
- API endpoint documentation is clear
- Schema field descriptions are comprehensive
- Service method documentation explains business logic
- Test documentation explains scenarios

**Success Criteria**:
- Code passes style checks
- Documentation is comprehensive and accurate
- No temporary or debug files remain
- Logging levels are appropriate
- Code follows established conventions

## Technical Specifications

### Request/Response Format

**Request**:
- HTTP Method: GET
- Path: `/api/v1/campaigns/{campaign_id}/status`
- Path Parameter: `campaign_id` (string, UUID format)
- Authentication: Required (Bearer token)

**Success Response** (200):
```json
{
    "campaign_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
    "campaign_name": "Test Campaign",
    "campaign_status": "running"
}
```

**Error Responses**:
- 401: Authentication required
- 404: Campaign not found
- 422: Invalid campaign ID format

### Database Queries
The endpoint will execute a single query to retrieve campaign information:
```sql
SELECT id, name, status FROM campaigns WHERE id = :campaign_id
```

### Performance Considerations
- Single database query per request
- No N+1 query problems
- Proper indexing on campaign.id (already exists as primary key)
- Minimal data transfer

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk Items
- Schema additions (following existing patterns)
- Service method addition (established pattern)
- Route addition (standard FastAPI pattern)

### Medium Risk Items  
- Authentication integration (well-established middleware)
- Database session handling (existing dependency injection)

### High Risk Items
- None identified - implementation follows established patterns

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise during implementation:
1. Revert changes to `app/schemas/campaign.py`
2. Revert changes to `app/services/campaign.py`  
3. Revert changes to `app/api/endpoints/campaigns.py`
4. Revert changes to `tests/test_campaigns_api.py`
5. Run test suite to ensure rollback is complete
