# Step 6: Business Rule Enforcement Implementation

## Overview

This document details the implementation of Step 6 from the Circuit Breaker Graceful Pausing Implementation Plan: **Business Rule Enforcement**. The goal was to enforce the rule that paused campaigns cannot be started and to provide comprehensive validation with detailed error messages.

## Implementation Summary

### ✅ Completed Features

1. **Enhanced Campaign Start Validation**
   - Comprehensive pre-start validation checking campaign status, circuit breaker state, and global pause conditions
   - Detailed error messages with actionable information
   - Appropriate HTTP status codes (409 for conflicts, 503 for service unavailable)

2. **Global Pause State Checking**
   - Campaign creation warns about service availability but allows creation
   - Campaign start prevents execution when services are unavailable
   - Global maintenance mode detection when too many services are down

3. **New API Endpoint for Validation**
   - `GET /api/v1/campaigns/{campaign_id}/start/validate` endpoint
   - Returns comprehensive validation results without actually starting the campaign
   - Helps users understand why a campaign cannot be started

4. **Enhanced Error Handling**
   - Structured error responses with detailed validation information
   - Service-specific error messages
   - Warnings vs. errors distinction

5. **Comprehensive Test Coverage**
   - 7 new business rule enforcement tests
   - Tests for all campaign status transitions
   - Validation endpoint testing
   - Error message structure validation

## Technical Implementation Details

### 1. Enhanced Campaign Service Methods

#### `create_campaign()` Enhancements
- Added global pause state checking during campaign creation
- Provides warnings about service availability in status messages
- Skips Instantly campaign creation if service is paused
- Allows campaign creation regardless of service state (with warnings)

#### `start_campaign()` Enhancements
- Uses comprehensive validation before starting
- Returns detailed error structures for validation failures
- Includes validation warnings in success responses
- Proper HTTP status codes based on failure type

#### New `validate_campaign_start_prerequisites()` Method
```python
def validate_campaign_start_prerequisites(self, campaign: Campaign) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Comprehensive validation of campaign start prerequisites.
    Returns detailed validation results for API responses.
    """
```

Returns structured validation results:
- `can_start`: Boolean indicating if campaign can be started
- `campaign_status_valid`: Campaign status validation result
- `services_available`: Service availability check result
- `global_state_ok`: Global system state validation
- `validation_details`: Detailed breakdown of all checks
- `warnings`: Non-blocking issues
- `errors`: Blocking issues

#### Enhanced `can_start_campaign()` Method
- Added explicit paused campaign check
- Critical vs. non-critical service distinction
- Global pause state detection
- Conservative error handling (fail-safe approach)

#### New `_check_global_pause_status()` Method
- Detects when too many services are down (>50%)
- Identifies critical service combinations (Apollo + Instantly)
- Returns detailed reasons for global pause state

### 2. New API Endpoint

#### Campaign Start Validation Endpoint
```python
@router.get("/{campaign_id}/start/validate", response_model=CampaignValidationResponse)
async def validate_campaign_start(campaign_id: str, db: Session, current_user: User):
    """Validate if a campaign can be started without actually starting it"""
```

**Benefits:**
- Allows frontend to check validation before attempting start
- Provides detailed feedback to users
- Enables better UX with specific error messages

### 3. Business Rules Enforced

#### Campaign Status Rules
- ✅ **PAUSED campaigns cannot be started** (must be resumed first)
- ✅ **COMPLETED campaigns cannot be started**
- ✅ **FAILED campaigns cannot be started**
- ✅ **RUNNING campaigns cannot be started again**
- ✅ Only **CREATED campaigns can be started**

#### Service Availability Rules
- ✅ **Apollo service is critical** - campaigns cannot start without it
- ✅ **All services required** - campaigns cannot start if any service is down
- ✅ **Global maintenance mode** - campaigns cannot start when >50% services down
- ✅ **Critical service combinations** - campaigns cannot start if Apollo + Instantly both down

#### Campaign Creation Rules
- ✅ **Always allow creation** - campaigns can be created even when services are down
- ✅ **Provide warnings** - status messages indicate service availability
- ✅ **Skip external integrations** - don't create Instantly campaigns when service is paused

### 4. Error Response Structure

#### Detailed Error Format
```json
{
  "detail": {
    "message": "Cannot start campaign due to validation failures",
    "errors": ["Campaign status issue: Cannot start paused campaign - resume it first"],
    "warnings": ["Some services unavailable: perplexity, openai"],
    "validation_details": {
      "campaign_status": {
        "current_status": "PAUSED",
        "can_start": false,
        "reason": "Cannot start paused campaign - resume it first"
      },
      "services": {
        "apollo": {"available": true, "reason": "Available"},
        "perplexity": {"available": false, "reason": "Circuit breaker open"},
        "openai": {"available": false, "reason": "Circuit breaker open"},
        "instantly": {"available": true, "reason": "Available"},
        "millionverifier": {"available": true, "reason": "Available"}
      },
      "global_state": {
        "is_paused": false,
        "reason": "System is operational"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### HTTP Status Codes
- **409 Conflict**: Campaign is in paused state
- **503 Service Unavailable**: Required services are down
- **400 Bad Request**: General validation errors

### 5. Test Coverage

#### New Test Functions
1. `test_paused_campaign_cannot_be_started()` - Verifies paused campaigns return 409 error
2. `test_campaign_start_validation_endpoint()` - Tests validation endpoint structure
3. `test_paused_campaign_validation_details()` - Tests detailed validation for paused campaigns
4. `test_completed_campaign_cannot_be_started()` - Tests completed campaign rejection
5. `test_failed_campaign_cannot_be_started()` - Tests failed campaign rejection
6. `test_running_campaign_cannot_be_started_again()` - Tests running campaign rejection
7. `test_detailed_error_messages_for_start_failures()` - Tests error message structure

#### Test Results
- **51 total tests** in campaign API test suite
- **All tests passing** ✅
- **7 new business rule tests** added

- **Other services treated as required** - campaigns cannot start if any are down
- **Future enhancement**: Make service criticality configurable

### Global Pause Thresholds
- **50% threshold** for global pause state
- **Critical combinations** (Apollo + Instantly) trigger global pause
- **Future enhancement**: Make thresholds configurable

### Error Handling Strategy
- **Conservative approach** - fail-safe when validation checks fail
