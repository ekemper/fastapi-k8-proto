please review these three files at the root of the project :

depricated-routes.py 
depricated-campaign_service.py
depricated-campaign-model.py
depricated-campaign-tests.py

the logic in these files is from another app ( flask )

i need to integrate the business logic from the campaign routes, service, model, and api integration tests in to this app. 

it is critical that only the business logic be preserved in migrating this logic to this app.

the patterns, conventions, and configuration that is specific to the old app should be ignored / removed.

the current patterns, conventions, and configuration for this app (fastapi-k8-proto) should be maintained  at all cost. 

pleaes create an extreamly detailed set of step by step instructions for an ai agent to perform this migration of the campaigns business logic ( routes, service, model, tests) . 

the instructions should break the process down in to discrete, testable steps .

each step should have a clear goal, a clear set of actions to be performed by the ai agent, and a strategy for confirming that the actions were sucessfull. ( either running tests, curling an endpoint, or checking for specific rows in a database table. )

in cases where there are code edits, the ai agent is to perform the changes

in cases where there are commands to be run, the ai agent is to run them in the chat window context and parse the output for errors and other actionable information

lets leave the unit tests out of the picture for the moment - I want a comprehensive set of functional api layer tests - the tests should hit the api and then check the database for results. 

please create a md document in the root of the project called campaign-business-logic-migration.md and put the instructions there for safe keeping
